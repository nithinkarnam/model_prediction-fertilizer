# Fertilizer Recommendation App

This Streamlit app predicts the recommended fertilizer for crops based on user-input parameters such as temperature, humidity, moisture level, soil type, crop type, and nutrient content.

## Background

The app features a background image and a dark theme for improved user experience. It utilizes a machine learning model (loaded from 'model.pkl') to make fertilizer predictions.

## Features

- **Custom Styling:** The app has a visually appealing background image and a dark theme to enhance user interaction.

- **Interactive Parameters:** Users can adjust sliders and select options to input parameters for fertilizer prediction.

- **Machine Learning Model:** The app uses a pickled machine learning model to make predictions based on user inputs.
